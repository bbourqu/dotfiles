mydotfiles
==========

Nothing big, just a place for me to keep my main dotfiles and to share what i find/do. 
Please note if you use anything here, its a work in progress, and i change stuff up frequently
Feel free to clone this to your local machine!
Also, if you deside you like what i do, please fork my repo!

First install git, then run: 

`git clone https://github.com/hackinginformation/mydotfiles.git`

If you want, I also have a inprogress installer that currently only works on ubuntu with bash running. 

`wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackinginformation/mydotfiles/master/install.sh | sh`

I plan to extend this to fedora and arch soon.

Currently I'm useing only
[Oh-My-ZSH][zsh] for pieces of my config, but i might be removeing this soon as i replace parts of it
& [vim-plug][plug] for the few vim plugins im using

[plug]:         https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
[zsh]:          https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
