Nothing big, just a place for me to keep my main dotfiles and to share what i find/do. 

Please note if you use anything here, its a work in progress, and i change stuff up frequently

## Installation

First install git, then run: 

`git clone https://github.com/hackinginformation/mydotfiles.git`

If you want, I also have a inprogress installer that currently only works on ubuntu with bash running. 

`wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackinginformation/mydotfiles/master/install.sh | sh`

I plan to extend this to fedora and arch soon.

## Plugins

[Oh-My-ZSH][zsh] for pieces of my config, but i might be removeing this soon as i replace parts of it
