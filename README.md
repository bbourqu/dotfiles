mydotfiles
==========

Nothing big, just a place for me to keep my main dotfiles and to share what i find/do. 
Please note if you use anything here, its a work in progress, and i change stuff up frequently
Feel free to clone this to your local machine.

First install git, then run: 

git clone https://github.com/hackinginformation/mydotfiles.git

Which will "clone" the files in this repo to your local filesystem. 

If you want to use these for your self, please note the .zshrc file needs to be in your home directory (~), you can symlink it if you want (ln -s <path to .zshrc you cloned from me> <where you want the file to be linked/.zshrc)

You will also need zsh installed (though your local repos) and you should also have oh-my-zsh installed

Via wget:
wget --no-check-certificate http://install.ohmyz.sh -O - | sh 

Via Curl:
curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh
