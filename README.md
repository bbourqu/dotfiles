# What this is for

Nothing big, just a place for me to keep my main dotfiles and to share what i find/do. 

Please note if you use anything here, its a work in progress, and i change stuff up frequently

**Please** 
* Feel free to clone this to your local machine!
* Also, if you deside you like what i do, please fork my repo!


## Installation

First install git, then run: 

`git clone https://github.com/hackinginformation/mydotfiles.git`

If you want, I also have a inprogress installer that currently only works on ubuntu with bash running. 

`wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackinginformation/mydotfiles/master/install.sh | sh`

I plan to extend this to fedora and arch soon.

## Plugins

Currently I'm useing only (installed with the [install script](install.sh))

[Oh-My-ZSH][zsh] for pieces of my config, but i might be removeing this soon as i replace parts of it

& [vim-plug][plug] for the few vim plugins im using
